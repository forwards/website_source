R is used around the world and yet, in English-speaking media at least, we tend 
to hear most about what is happening in North America, Europe, and Australasia.
So we would like to highlight some recent initiatives in the R 
community from other regions of the world, with this first post in the series 
focusing on R in Africa.

## satRdays in Cape Town

Following the first successful 
[satRday in Budapest](http://budapest.satrdays.org/) on 3 September 2016, a 
[satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/) was held on 
18 February 2017. The event was hosted at 
[Workshop 17](http://workshop17.co.za/) in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. 
There were three great keynote speakers 
([Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan), 
[Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and 
[Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke)). In addition to the invited 
speakers the organizers received 41 contributed proposals, of which 23 were 
accepted: 3 tutorials, 8 standard talks and 12 lightning talks. Just over 200 
tickets were issued for the event and the venue was literally packed. On two 
days prior to the conference there were workshops by the keynote speakers. 
These were also very well attended.

*<br/>satRday was an excellent networking opportunity!*

A second [satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2018.satrdays.org/) is now
planned for 17 March 2018, with two exciting keynote speakers: [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/maelle) and 
[Stephanie Kovalchik](https://twitter.com/StatsOnTheT). 
They will be presenting workshops on R package development and sports analytics
with R on the day prior to the conference.

Next year's conference will be held at a bigger venue on the campus of the 
University of Cape Town, which will be able to accommodate even more 
enthusiastic R users. Tickets are on sale and the 
[Call for Papers](https://www.papercall.io/satrday-cape-town-2018) is open.

## Software/Data Carpentry

Since 2015 [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and 
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) have been enabling R capacity
development in Africa. Software and Data Carpentry host two-day workshops 
teaching researchers and postgraduate students foundational skills to assist 
with better research software development and data analysis respectively. 
The Carpentries are global non-profit volunteer organisations that not only 
teach tools like R, Python, SQL, and git/Github, but also run a two-day 
[instructor training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) 
to help technical experts teach more effectively.

*<br/>Highlights from Carpentry workshops*

Over the past three years more than 30 workshops were run in countries like 
[South Africa](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/05/instructor-training-south-africa.html), 
[Mauritius](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/mauritius.html), Ghana,
[Gabon](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/mauritius.html),
[Namibia](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/namibia.html), Botswana,
[Kenya](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/tdwg/), and
[Ethiopia](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/ethiopia.html). These 
workshops have reached hundreds of researchers and students who mostly had 
limited or no prior exposure to programming. 

More information about the lessons we teach is available at the websites: 
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and 
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/).

If you'd like to get involved in Carpentries in Africa, please

## R-Ladies in Africa

The set-up of a Cape Town chapter of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) 
was inspired by the first satRday
conference in Cape Town. All three plenary speakers at that conference
were part of the R-Ladies community and it was extremely refreshing to go to a
conference largely about science and technology where women took the centre 
stage. Cape Town is a multicultural, multilingual and multiracial city, but this
diversity is not represented in the R user community. The aim of the Cape Town 
chapter of R-Ladies is to grow the female R user community in Cape Town and
bring to it the diversity of cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds present in 
the city. By the end of 2017 the group will have had five meetups since their 
launch in July this year. They are still quite a small group, but they are 
confident they will grow in time. One might expect that there would be 
many more people using R in a big city, but issues with congestion and public
transport may form a barrier to people attending. The answer might be to form
even more R-Ladies chapters around different parts of the city so that people
don’t have to travel far! R-Ladies Cape Town can be reached at 
<capetown@rladies.org> and on 
[Twitter @RLadiesCapeTown](https://twitter.com/rladiescapetown).

R Ladies Addis was founded on October 30, 2017 in the course of the 2nd Data 
Carpentry Workshop in Addis Ababa, with 7 founding members and 2 honorary 
members. Thanks to the support provided by Ms. Anelda van der Walt from 
South Africa, an honorary member of R Ladies Addis as well as the R Ladies 
community, R Ladies Addis got ready for its first meeting on November 14, 2017. 
The agenda of this meeting was to decide the framework of R 
Ladies Addis activities. The group has set its special focus on working 
with women students and women researchers by offering R training and R
competitions. R Ladies Addis has been invited to reach out to the different 
corners of Ethiopia. For the time being R Ladies is present at 
https://r-ladies-addis.github.io/studyGroup and can be reached by e-mail
<addisababa@rladies.org>.

*<br/>1st Meeting of R Ladies Addis on Nov. 14, 2017*

A new chapter of R-Ladies will soon be starting in Cotonou, Benin. The 
organizers plan to have their first meeting in January to conincide with the 
start of the new academic year. Follow the group on 
[Twitter, @RLadiesCtn](https://twitter.com/RLadiesCtn) or email 
<cotonou@rladies.org> to find out more! Local R-Ladies also hope to
establish groups in Fez, Morocco and Johannesburg, South Africa; if you are 
interested in these groups, or interested in starting a chapter in your own area
(in Africa or beyond!) you can contact <info@rladies.org>.

## >eR-Biostat: making R based education materials accessible for all

One of the main problems in education at both undergraduate and master's 
levels in developing countries is the lack of high quality materials 
for courses in education programs. The **>eR-Biostat** initiative is focused on 
providing **R-based** materials for higher education programs in
Biostatistics/Statistics, as well as introductory materials for 
non-statisticians and in future, an E-learning system for courses at different 
education levels.

Courses are organized in four clusters and are ready to be delivered in class. 
The **Introductory courses** aim to train students in data analysis using R at a 
basic level. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both 
non-statisticians and statisticians. The courses within this cluster can also 
be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate programs in
biostatistics/statistics. The **Basic courses** are designed for an 
intermediate level and a basic knowledge in statistics is required in order to 
follow the courses. The courses within this cluster can be used as training
courses for non-statisticians and as courses to support R usage in 
undergraduate programs in biostatistics/statistics. The 
**Statistical modelling (I)** and **Statistical modelling (II)** clusters
consist of basic and advanced courses, respectively, at master's level in 
biostatistics/statistics.

## Other activities

Here we have focused on some of the more recent initiatives, but of 
course there are many other groups encouraging the use of R in Africa. For 
example, several general R User Groups have been established; many are listed 
on the [Data Science Africa web site](http://datascience-africa.org/) and a few 
more are listed on the [R User Groups](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html) 
listing hosted by jumping rivers. On the education side, the centres of the 
[African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://www.nexteinstein.org/) 
often use R in their courses and workshops. In particular AIMS Tanzania is a 
partner in the 
[Africa Data Initiative](http://www.africanmathsinitiative.net/blog/initiatives/african-data-initiative/) 
that developed [R-Instat](http://r-instat.org/index.html) a front-end to R 
designed to make R more accessible for students. Going beyond 
the classroom, 
[BeST (Bespoke eStyle Statistical Training for Africa and South Asia)](http://yieldingresults.org/) assist in upskilling scientists working in
agricultural development via online courses in R. If you are aware of other 
such initiatives, feel free to share them in the comments!
