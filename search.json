    "text": "Data Security\nForwards will limit the data collected to that necessary for the task at hand. Since most surveys/forms will contain direct identifiers (e.g. name, email) and/or personal information (e.g. age, ethnicity, sexuality) we treat all data collected as confidential and take action to protect against breaches of personal identifiable information.\n\nData collection\nFor surveys conducted by Forwards or in partnership with collaborators, we ensure a secure survey/form platform is used. In particular, we ensure the platform is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. Access to the platform is restricted to a small number of Forwards members and/or collaborators for the purpose of collecting and downloading the data. Once the full data is downloaded the copy on the survey/form platform is deleted.\n\n\nData storage\n\nSurveys\nRaw data containing personal and potentially identifiable information is stored in a private GitHub repository. Access to this repository is restricted to the survey team. If a member leaves the survey team, their access to the repository will be revoked and they will be asked to delete any personal copies of the data. Survey data may be shared with selected collaborators to assist us with statistical analysis, and potentially other academic researchers whose aims are consistent with our own, for example those studying participation in open source projects.\nAll collaborators are expected to observe good security practices, in particular:\n\nworking on password-protected computers that are screen-locked when unattended,\nensuring any back-ups are password-protected or encrypted,\nnot accessing private repositories over insecure WIFI connections, and\nnot working in an environment where third-parties can easily over-look.\n\n\n\nOther forms\nOther forms may be used to collect data for a specific purpose, e.g.  applications for a diversity scholarship scheme or expressions of interest in a conference buddy scheme. The data for these forms will either be stored in a private GitHub repository (or similarly secure online storage) or offline, with access restricted to the Forwards members responsible for the task.\n\n\n\nData retention\nRaw data is kept according to the following schedules:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey/form type\nRetention time\n\n\n\n\nDiversity scholarship applications\nUntil all scholarships paid out\n\n\nExpression of interest form\nUntil task/event completed\n\n\nDemographic/community survey\nIndefinitely\n\n\n\nData that has served its purpose will be deleted or anonymised - anonymised data may be kept to inform future activities.\n\n\nData publication\n\nSurveys\nSince survey data is of interest to the community at large, we do publish the results, but only in forms that minimise risk of personal identification and disclosure of sensitive information. This can mean presenting aggregate summaries (as for example in this Mapping useRs blog post), excluding certain variables, or modifying the data to achieve at least 3-anonymity over implicit identifiers (as for the useR2016 data published in the forwards package).\n\n\nOther forms\nData collected in other forms will not be published or shared with third parties.\n\n\n\nContact\nAny questions or comments on our privacy policy should be sent to rowforwards@gmail.com."

    "text": "Overview\nThanks to generous funding from the R Consortium, Forwards is pleased to offer the following workshops to support the development of coding skills and increase the participation of women in the R community:\n\nWorkshops for women are designed for women with some R coding experience who wish to learn more about package development, thereby addressing the skills gap that exists within the R community. As of 2016, an analysis of CRAN package maintainers estimated that fewer than 15% were women, and a useR! participant survey found that women were less likely than men to have experience contributing to or writing packages. Workshop participants learn to make code into an R package, do collaborative coding with GitHub, write a vignette or an article, build a package web page, and submit a package to CRAN. Participants can bring their own code that they wish to develop into a package or work with a Forwards example.\nWorkshops for high school girls serve as an introduction to coding in R and are designed for students interested in STEM, coding, and data analysis. Participants learn about plotting data, web scraping, and the development of Shiny apps. A selection of topics related to contemporary current affairs are used, and where possible, incorporate data specific to the workshop’s geographic location.\n\n\n\nUpcoming workshops\n\nPackage development workshop for women & other underrepresented groups at the University York\n2020-01-07, York, UK\nFree to attend, travel scholarships available for travel within the UK.

    "section": "Adjusting for non-response",
    "text": "Adjusting for non-response\nIn order to adjust for the difference in gender balance between the sample and the full population, weights may be computed for males and females so that the ratio of females to males based on adjusted counts (sum of weights in each category) is equal to that estimated for the full sample. Specifically, the weight for females is 0.76 and the weight for males is 1.14.\nThese weights can then be used in further analysis, for example when tabulating by another survey variable. Here we will consider a few examples for illustration.\n\nAge\nThe unweighted and weighted densities have a very similar shape, but using the weighting shifts the density slightly to the left, i.e. when females are down-weighted there is a slight shift to a generally older population.\n\n\n\nEducation level\nHere there is very little difference between the unweighted and weighted counts.\n\n\n\nQ7\nCount\nAdj.Count\n\n\n\n\nProfessional degree or certification\n10\n10.67\n\n\nDoctorate\n199\n200.69\n\n\nMasters degree\n187\n186.06\n\n\nUndergraduate degree\n52\n50.63\n\n\nHigh school/Secondary school or lower\n3\n3.05\n\n\nNA\n7\n6.90\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment status\nAgain the differences between unweighted and weighted counts are small here, however there is a consistent shift from less financially secure positions (student, unemployed and employed non-permenantly in academia) to more financially secure positions (employed permenantly in academia, employed in industry). This tallies with the younger distribution of females noted above.\n\n\n\nQ8\nCount\nAdj.Count\n\n\n\n\nEmployed in industry\n183\n186.24\n\n\nEmployed permanently in academia\n76\n78.08\n\n\nEmployed non-permanently in academia\n59\n57.10\n\n\nEmployed in government/non-profit\n70\n69.54\n\n\nSelf-employed\n6\n6.48\n\n\nRetired\n2\n2.29\n\n\nStudent\n44\n40.71\n\n\nUnemployed\n4\n3.42\n\n\nNA\n14\n14.14\n\n\n\n\n\nTime using R\nWith the weighted counts we see a slight shift towards greater experience; this again tallies with females being generally younger and less advanced in their careers.\n\n\n\nQ11\nCount\nAdj.Count\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 10 years\n119\n123.28\n\n\n5-10 years\n132\n132.38\n\n\n2-5 years\n118\n118.05\n\n\n1-2 years\n35\n31.57\n\n\n6-12 months\n29\n28.17\n\n\n&lt; 6 months\n9\n8.76\n\n\nNA\n16\n15.80\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational use of R\nWith the weighted counts we see a shift towards using R for recreational activity alone or as well as for work. Since the weighting down-weights females relative to males this suggests males are more able or more willing to use R for fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ14\nCount\nAdj.Count\n\n\n\n\nFor both recreational and job/educational purposes.\n160\n169.41\n\n\nPrimarily as a recreational activity, in your free time;\n4\n4.58\n\n\nPrimarily as part of a job or educational course;\n275\n265.55\n\n\nNA\n19\n18.46\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe examples above illustrate that the difference between unweighted and weighted counts tends to be small and is unlikely to affect conclusions drawn about the distribution of a particular variable in the useR! population as a whole.\nWhere there is a material difference between unweighted and weighted counts, this can be attributed to gender, since the weighting only depends on this factor. In this case it would be more interesting to explore the gender difference by showing a summary grouped by gender and then the weighting becomes irrelevant as we are no longer trying to represent the whole population.\nSummarising by gender will necessarily exclude individuals that are non-binary or have not stated their gender. In addition, summarising by gender can result in (more) categories containing only a few individuals, which is undesirable as we wish to protect anonymity. Therefore a grouped summary should only be used when there is a substantive gender difference and small groups can be combined without too much loss of information. First considering the unweighted and weighted counts can help in making this judgement. Using the weights in this exploratory way is perhaps more appropriate than using them to adjust the counts, given that they are based in part on predicted data."

Since we are using a density summary there is no issue with small sub-groups.\nBreaking down by gender shows the difference in age distribution much more clearly:\n\n\n\nEducation level\nAlthough there is some evidence of a more educated male population (weighted counts shift to higher education levels) the difference is small. In addition the numbers without university-level education are very small and even combined with the missing group there is potential that individuals are identified when broken down by gender. Therefore it is best to keep genders combined here and base the final summary on unweighted counts.\n\n\n\nEmployment status\nHere the shift from unweighted counts to weighted counts is larger. Although there are small groups, these can reasonably be combined into an “Other” category.\n\n\n\nTime using R\nAgain there are material differences between unweighted and weighted counts, here the original groups can be left as is:\n\n\n\nRecreational use of R\nHere there is a clear difference between unweighted and weighted counts. As only four people (men) said that they used R primarily as a recreational activity, this can be combined with the missing category:"

Where there is a substantive difference, it is interesting to explore this difference in a grouped summary, where again the over-representation of women becomes irrelevant as males and females are summarised separately.\nTherefore rather than base final summaries on weighted counts, which are based in part on predicted data, it is better to use the weighted counts as a guide to when a grouped summary is appropriate."

    "text": "Analysis of the uses of R\nThe following graphic summarizes relationships between the answers to the “uses of R” questions. To interpret the main dimensions of variability in the response profiles, we base our analysis on the proximities between categories. Two categories are close on the graph when individuals who have selected the first category also tend to take the other category.\n\nProximities between categories Q11.NA and Q14.NA indicate that people who did not answer Q11 (How long have you been using R for?) often did not answer Q14 (Do you use R as a recreational activity, primarily as part of a job or both?). However, it only concerns 16 individuals.\nWe can see on the graph a gradient which shows the relationship between the question Q11 related to the experience in R programming and the question Q13 related to the use of R, with people on the right, who have recently started using R, and people on the left, who have used R for a long time. In particular, the users with more than 10 years’ experience have already written their own package or contributed to packages, while people with less than 2 years’ experience haven’t. The gradient can be clearly interpreted and shows the progression in gaining new skills.\nThe beginners in R seem to be trying R during their free time. This is less true for experienced users who have probably gained their experience during their job. Note that beginners in R are very few among respondents (9 people with less than 6 months’ experience).\nThe graph of the individuals allows identification of the individuals located at the top right who do not answer some questions. These individuals did not answer any of the questions related to their use of R but answered the demographic questions. Interestingly, one of them indicated they just discovered R (in the text answer Q25). This explanation could also be valid for the other ones, explaining why they agree to participate to the study, yet only answer a few questions. This comment is in line with the previous graph, in which categories NA are on the right, which is the location of inexperienced users."

More interestingly, the second dimension of the graph highlights that people thinking very strongly that R is monotonous also think that it is not fun, not cool, or even think R is poor. It highlights that among respondents there is a sub-population of people who do not appreciate R. However, it concerns around 10 individuals.\nInterestingly, these respondents tend to recommend R to a friend as a programming language to learn, so that they recognize some interest."

The graph above shows that the demographic characteristics are significantly related to the user profiles. An analysis of variance with demographic variables as covariates, and the coordinates of the individuals on the dimensions as explanatory variables, has been performed1. The graph shows that people with a doctorate are more highly represented among advanced users. This also shows that men are more highly represented than women among the most advanced users. As stated in the post useRs Relationship with R, it could be explained by the fact that women tend to be younger, but here we note that the variable Age does not significantly explain the coordinates of the individuals on the graph. To get more insight into this possible confounding effect, we created a variable sex-age and represent it. The plot confirms that men are over-represented amongst the advanced users."

To do this, a hierarchical clustering is performed on K principal components of the MCA. The rationale is to improve the stability of the clustering by building it from denoised data.\nSeveral rules can be used to select the number of components used for the clustering. Here we choose 12 dimensions which corresponds to 95% of the projected inertia (variance) of the data.\n\nThe number of clusters is chosen according to the barplot of the inertia gains2 which suggests 3 clusters.\nHowever, since a cluster with non-respondents is expected, we consider 4 clusters to have a more interpretable clustering.\n\nThe first cluster located on the left represent the experienced users while the second cluster gathers the intermediate users and the third one the beginners. The fourth cluster is constituted with people who did not answer.\nThe size of each cluster is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\nsize\n171\n260\n11\n13\n\n\n\ni.e. in terms of proportions:\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\nproportion\n0.38\n0.57\n0.02\n0.03\n\n\n\nWe now interpret the clusters.\n\nCluster 1\nTo help us describing the first cluster, we use statistical tests to compare the proportion of each category in the cluster versus the proportion in the population of the respondents. Of course, for variables that have been used to build the clusters (Q11, Q13, Q14), this test is only indicative, but for others (demographic questions or perception questions), the p.values can be interpreted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCla/Mod\nMod/Cla\nGlobal\np.value\n\n\n\n\nQ13_F=rel_pkg_yes\n96.77\n87.72\n34.07\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_D=ctb_pkg_yes\n88.37\n88.89\n37.80\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_E=wrt_pkg_yes\n71.85\n100.00\n52.31\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_C=wrt_func_yes\n42.93\n97.66\n85.49\n3.5e-10\n\n\nQ13_B=wrt_code_yes\n42.35\n97.08\n86.15\n1.4e-08\n\n\nQ2=Men\n46.64\n77.19\n62.20\n2.2e-07\n\n\nQ7=Doctorate\n50.75\n59.06\n43.74\n3.5e-07\n\n\nQ11=&gt; 10 years\n57.14\n39.77\n26.15\n4.6e-07\n\n\nQ15=fun_Strongly agree\n49.54\n62.57\n47.47\n5.7e-07\n\n\nQ14=For both recreational and job/educational purposes.\n52.50\n49.12\n35.16\n1.7e-06\n\n\nQ1_new=Q1_new_Academic/Govt\n46.81\n51.46\n41.32\n0.00071\n\n\nQ8=Q8_Employed non-permanently in academia\n57.63\n19.88\n12.97\n0.00089\n\n\nQ8=Q8_Employed permanently in academia\n53.95\n23.98\n16.70\n0.00157\n\n\n\nThe table can be interpreted as follows:\n\nfirst row indicates that 96.77% of individuals that have released their own R package are in cluster 1; 87.72% of individuals in this cluster have released their own R package, and 34.07% of individuals in the population have released their own R package.\n\nrow 7 indicates that 50.75% of individuals with a doctorate are in this cluster; 59.06% of individuals in this cluster have a doctorate, and 43.74% of individuals in the population have a doctorate. We can reject at risk 3.47e-07 the null hypothesis the proportion of respondents with a doctorate in the first cluster is the same than the proportion in the population of the respondents. This first table only represents the results when the proportion in the cluster is larger than the proportion in the population.\n\nTo wrap-up, the tests results confirm that cluster 1 gathers experienced users. In this cluster, there is an over-representation of people with a doctorate, men, or people employed in academia. It is also a cluster where the proportion of people strongly seeing R programming as fun is large. In the same line, people in cluster 1 are more likely to use R for both recreational and job/educational purposes.\nThis second table represents the categories that are underrepresented in cluster 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCla/Mod\nMod/Cla\nGlobal\np.value\n\n\n\n\nQ13_F=rel_pkg_no\n7.00\n12.28\n65.93\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_D=ctb_pkg_no\n6.71\n11.11\n62.20\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_E=wrt_pkg_no\n0.00\n0.00\n47.69\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ13_C=wrt_func_no\n6.06\n2.34\n14.51\n3.5e-10\n\n\nQ13_B=wrt_code_no\n7.94\n2.92\n13.85\n1.4e-08\n\n\nQ11=6-12 months\n0.00\n0.00\n6.37\n6.6e-07\n\n\nQ2=Women\n23.08\n22.81\n37.14\n6.6e-07\n\n\nQ1_new=Q1_new_Industry\n26.46\n29.24\n41.54\n3.3e-05\n\n\nQ8=Q8_Employed in industry\n26.23\n28.07\n40.22\n3.7e-05\n\n\nQ14=Q14.NA\n0.00\n0.00\n3.52\n0.00045\n\n\nQ11=1-2 years\n11.43\n2.34\n7.69\n0.00046\n\n\nQ7=Masters degree\n28.34\n30.99\n41.10\n0.00065\n\n\nQ14=Primarily as part of a job or educational course;\n31.64\n50.88\n60.44\n0.00131\n\n\nQ11=Q11.NA\n0.00\n0.00\n2.86\n0.00196\n\n\nQ5=United States\n32.91\n60.82\n69.45\n0.00217\n\n\n\nUS people are under-represented in cluster 1.

If so, the deletion of missing individuals for subsequent analyses would reduce the scope of the analysis since the sample would be restricted to R users only. However, the cluster of individuals who do not answer these questions, do not answer any of the R community questions as well. Consequently, it can also be individuals who have started answering the questions and stopped before finishing. So we decide to delete this group for the other analyses.\n\nPractices of R are linked to the experience of the users. In particular, users with more than 10 years’ experience have already written their own package, while people with less than 2 years’ experience haven’t.\nA focus on the demographic characteristics of the participants highlights experienced users are more likely men than women, more likely from academia than from industry and more likely people with a doctorate than without. They often use R both for their job and for pleasure. Intermediate users use R for less than 2 years, they mainly use existing packages. Intermediate users are mainly women, people with undergraduate and master degrees and less men or people with doctoral degrees. Beginners are trying R during their free time.\nTo conclude, we should suggest using “yes” and “no” answers for the checkboxes to distinguish missing values from “no”. In addition, we should be cautious about over-interpretation and keep in mind that their is a strong age effect: there are many women who are young."

There was a greater increase in poster contributions from women than lightning or regular talks in 2016, which perhaps reflects a lower level of experience among the newcomers.\nPlot c shows groups that are more heavily selected. The numbers of female invited speakers has increased from zero in the early years (2004-2008) through one in later years (2009-2013) to two in recent years - this is the level that useR! is seeking to maintain for now. The number of tutorials with a female tutor was decreasing since 2007, but went up again to 1/3 in 2016. This is the target for 2017. useR! does not always have panel sessions, but apart from a panel in 2014 on women in the R community, women have been poorly represented. This is something useR! plans to address in any future panels.\nThe last plot shows invited organisational roles. Data on session chairs is only available for a few years, but recently the proportion of women has been similar that of attendees. The proportion of female committee members has been slowly rising to parity over the history of useR! (with an unusual high in 2007 when Di Cook, a taskforce member was a key organiser). The make-up of the local organising committee is much more variable, partly because the size of the committee changes a lot according to local needs. In recent years the proportion of women on the committee has been similar to or greater than that of attendees."

For a long time, data scientists and related disciplines have relied on R and many other packages to analyse data, however, the broader developer community didn’t fully understand its power in the tech industry. An effective model to enter the Africa developer ecosystem relies on a small group of enthusiasts creating a safe learning environment, documenting and sharing their learning experiences and slowly attracting interested learners.

The community has responded and a number of conferences are planned for the coming months.\n\nInternational Seminar on Statistics with R\nOne of the first to spot the demand was Luciane Alcoforado, a professor at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Realizing there was no large R event in Brazil, she set about coordinating the first International Seminar on Statistics with R (SER: Seminário Internacional de Estatística com R), which was held in Niterói in May 2016.\n Luciane Alcoforado, Coordinator of the first SER\nMore than 250 people attended this pioneering event, with attendance balanced across academia and industry. Encouraged by this success, the I SER organizers ran the event again in 2017, with an expanded program and similar numbers attending.\n Sean Kross presents remotely at the first SER\nA third edition, III SER, is now planned for May 22-24, 2018, to be hosted again by UFF in Niterói, Brazil. On the first day, 8 mini courses will be run, aimed at both practitioners and students. This year most of the international guests come from the USA and England. They include Jesse Mostipak, Becky Pattinson, Garreth Maccray, and Gabriela de Queiroz. These guests will present alongside invited speakers from the local region. There will also be thirty selected contributed talks and a poster session with awards for the best three of each. It’s a huge opportunity to get your research known. The last conference day will close with a tribute session to Prof. Djalma Pessoa who was a pioneer R user in Brazil.\nRegistration to III SER and the mini-courses is open now and the call for papers is open until March 23 2018.\n\n\nR Day\nA second event in Brazil, R Day, will take place at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), Curitiba, on May 22, 2018. The Statistics Department at UFPR was one of the first in Brazil to adopt R as the standard programming language for statistics teaching, in 2002. It was also the first institution to host a CRAN mirror in the country, and started the R-br mailing list in 2011, which now has more than 1000 subscribers.\nThe R Day is organized as a satellite event of the 63rd RBRAS meeting (Brazilian Region of the International Biometric Society), and is endorsed by the R Foundation to further develop the academic R community in Brazil. There will be three keynotes, 9 oral presentations, and 8 tutorials, aimed at both users and developers. The main goal is to be community-driven, so anyone can submit proposals for oral presentations and/or tutorials (only the three keynote speakers will be invited by the organizers).\nThe aim of R Day is to gather the vast R community in Brazil, by offering the possibility for users and developers to show their work and exchange experience on all sorts of R subjects. Proposals for oral presentations and tutorials are open until April 04. The registration is free and can be made until April 22.\nFor more information and updates, registration and proposal forms, checkout the R Day website, and follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\n R Day logo (left), Curitiba Botanical Garden (top right), and UFPR historical building (bottom right)\n\n\nsatRday Bogota\nThe first Latin American chapter of the one day conference series satRdays will take place in Bogota, Colombia in August 2018. The focus of the conference will be about tidy concepts applied to data visualization. It is organized by Datasketch, a Data Journalism Portal for Latin America.\nThe main goal of the conference is to create a common space for interaction among newbies and experts in R. Special interest will be given to works created by or for underrepresented communities and to showcase different solutions developed using R for the different elections that are happening in 2018 in different Latin American countries.\nThere are tentative plans for a workshop session the day before with hands-on tutorials about:\n\nData visualization and common mistakes.\nData structuring and preparation: PDFs, Databases and API’s.\n\nA website containing more details will be available soon.\n\n\nLatinR\nOn October 25, 2017, an announcement was made by Heather Turner on the RUG Organizers Slack: the R Foundation Conference Committee would like to see academic-focused R events in regions not currently covered by useR! In less than a week, a group of Latam R-Ladies were organizing their first conference-call to start thinking about how this challenge could be achieved. This quick response was not the result of mere chance, but the consequence of a year in which the R community — both RUG and R-Ladies groups — grew stronger in South America. By mid November everything was set-up: a name, a place, a date, and a motivated international organizing committee.\nLatinR 2018 will be held in Buenos Aires on September 4-5 within the 47th Argentinian Meeting of Informatics and Operational Research (JAIIO), which is organized by The Argentinian Informatics Society (SADIO). With a diverse and renowned Scientific Committee, this two-day event aims to bring together researchers, students, and R-enthusiasts from different backgrounds in order to strengthen the R community and make the impact that R is having in the region more visible, in both academic and non academic contexts.\nFor more information about oral presentations & poster submission, keynotes, and workshops, you can check out the LatinR website or follow us on Twitter and Facebook: @LatinR2018.\n\n\nConectaR 2019\nIn 2019, it is Costa Rica’s turn: ConectaR 2019 will take place in San José. The event has the endorsement of R Foundation and will be hosted at the University of Costa Rica (UCR). ConectaR has an organizing committee comprising members of academia (School of Statistics, Pure and Applied Mathematics Research Center (CIMPA)), public research centers (The Development Observatory, Bioversity International (CGIAR)) and industry (ixpantia). ConectaR will have two keynote speakers (yet to be confirmed) and will be receiving proposals for oral presentations and posters starting April 2018. In addition to that, there will be tutorials, invited talks, and a job fair. An attendance of over 150 people is expected, with the goal of building a community of R users in the Central American Region."

As a result, the field faces computational challenges to analyse such data. The R/Bioconductor project is an open source, open development software platform that provides tools to translate complex data sets into biological knowledge. An R/Bioconductor workshop will be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico on July 30 - Aug 3, 2018.\nThe workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in the analysis of biological data. We encourage applications from diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers. The main goals of the workshop are:\n\nTeaching participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages.\nTurning bioinformatic software users into bioinformatic software developers.\nFostering the exchange of expertise and establishing multidisciplinary collaborations.\nCreating a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for biological data analysis.\nHelping to train bioinformatics instructors that can continue to grow in their local communities.\n\nThis workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to BioC, EuroBioc and BioCAsia) where attendees present their own software contributions.\nA website containing more details will be available soon.\n\n\nLocal groups\nBeyond conferences and workshops, local groups provide a venue for R users to meet more regularly. Jumping Rivers provide a user group directory, which also covers R-Ladies groups, however as R-Ladies are expanding rapidly it is worth checking the R-Ladies Starter Kit for the latest status.\nRecently members of the RUG and R-Ladies groups in Bogota, Columbia collaborated on a striking intervention about feminicides in Colombia using plots created in R. Read more on their initiative in this report (warning: readers may find the content distressing). This is an example of how local groups can work together on wider issues as well as providing networking and development opportunities for their members.\n\n\nMaking Connections\nPart of building the community in Latin America is making connections between disconnected groups. If you think we have missed something, or you would like to be involved in plans for future events in the region, let us know in the comments or contact us on email (rowforwards at gmail dot com) or Twitter.\nBanner image shows the poster session at I SER."

Mentors and managers should recognize that people from under-represented groups may need additional support to fill in gaps in their programming knowledge. To encourage people from under-represented groups to develop as R programmers and contribute to the community, we recommend promoting opportunities and activities that are paid and/or help to advance their careers."

The following plot shows the percentages within each experience category for each gender:\n\n66% of women (109 of 165) said they had programming experience before learning to use R, compared with 82% of men (227 of 276). Since women tend to be younger, this could be due to increasing use of R in teaching, particularly on undergraduate courses. Thus younger people generally are less likely to have used other languages for data analysis such as SAS, Stata, S-plus, Genstat, etc. However it could indicate a different background of women vs. men, in particular they may be less likely to have any formal training in computer science, where they might have been taught C/C++, Java etc before learning R.\nWe also asked about how people use the language. Respondents were asked to confirm that any or all of the following statements applied to them:\n\n“I use functions from existing R packages to analyze data”\n“I write R code designed to make my work easier, such as loops or conditionals or functions”\n“I write R functions for use by myself or my collaborators”\n“I contribute to R packages (on CRAN or elsewhere)”\n“I have written my own R package”\n“I have written my own R package and released it on CRAN or Bioconductor (or shared it on GitHub, R-Forge or similar platforms)”\n\nAs might be expected given the length of time useR! attendees have been using R, their use is generally quite advanced with the vast majority using techniques to control the flow of their code (86%, 392 of 458) or writing custom R functions (85%, 389 of 458). More than half have written their own package(s) (52%, 238 of 458) and a third have publicly released a package (34%, 155 of 458).\nReflecting the distribution of length of R programming experience, the proportion of women using advanced programming techniques is slightly lower than men and when it comes to package development the proportion is lower still:\n\nThe final question we asked regarding use of R was whether the attendees use R primarily for work, recreation or both. The results were significantly different for men and women, only 22% of women (35 of 162) use R for both work and recreation compared to 45% of men (147 of 275); the few people that use R for recreation only were all men. Although factors such as age and programming experience may come into play here, it is likely that social expectations of women are also a factor. For example, although responsibility for cooking, childcare and housework is shared more evenly among working couples, in different sex couples women often shoulder a greater responsibility1. With reduced leisure time, women may be less willing to use R just for fun, or may feel less able to do so, due to expectations of their family and friends about how they should spend their free time.\n\nOverall, this paints a picture of useR! attendees as a population of mostly long-term R programmers often writing code for more than their individual use - which makes sense. As we discussed in our first post, conferences are expensive in terms of both time and money, so a conference on R is most viable for people that use R substantially in their work and hence can justify the cost to their employers. As the main conference organised by the R Foundation, useR! is particularly attractive to dedicated contributors to the R project, indeed talks and posters should present a contribution which will often be a new package or contribution to a package. This goes some way to explaining some of the inequalities in attendee demographics; we know from separate research (albeit using a rather crude metric) that CRAN maintainers, for example, are mostly not women.2\nWe have seen that the women that do attend useR! tend to be younger and less experienced. We have not explored the programming experience of other under-represented groups, for example with regard to ethnicity or sexual orientation, as the numbers in the sample are much lower, prohibiting reliable statistical conclusions and creating issues with identifiability. It is possible that, like women, members of other under-represented groups are also less likely to use R for recreation, as they will tend to have less time or money than is the norm.3 This indicates a barrier to women and other under-represented groups transitioning from useRs to developeRs: package authorship and maintenance, and dedication to an open source community, is largely uncompensated.\n\n\nOpinions about R\nThe second part of our section on R programming asked respondents for their opinions on R. On these questions there were no significant differences between the responses from men and women, so we present the results for all respondents, including non-binary individuals and those that did not declare their gender.\nWe first asked respondents how strongly they agreed or disagreed with the following statements:\n\nwriting R is fun\nwriting R is considered cool or interesting by my peers\nwriting R is a monotonous task\nwriting R is difficult\n\nThe results are presented below:\n\nWe see that respondents overwhelmingly agree that writing R is fun, so even those people that use R primarily for work enjoy doing so. The view of their peers is slightly less positive, with 12% (51 of 438) stating that writing R is not considered cool or interesting by their peers and 15% having no opinion on this (65 of 438). Even among those who agreed with the second statement, the proportion that strongly agreed is lower compared to the first statement. So although the overall picture is positive, there is a sizable group for which writing R is not encouraged by their peers, which could affect their motivation to contribute, particularly outside of work.\nThe majority (61%, 269 of 438) disagree with the statement that writing R is difficult. Those that agreed with this statement are spread across the experience levels, so some may have been expressing a general opinion about R programming rather than a personal one, necessarily. The disagreement is stronger (80%, 349 of 438) against the statement that writing R is a monotonous task, so while writing R may occasionally be difficult most useR! attendees find it challenging and interesting.\nThe generally positive view of R among useR! attendees is not so surprising, after all most will have chosen to attend the conference, or if it was required by their work they have expressed an interest in R by applying for that job or choosing to use R at work in the first place. Nonetheless, the positive view is a benefit to the community as useRs encourage people to take up R and contribute more to the R project, with many useRs being in a position to teach R, mentor junior colleagues/students or contribute to community events such as R user groups or R-ladies.\n91% (418 of 439) said that they would recommend R to friends and colleagues. The reasons some people would not recommend R include a steep learning curve, too many idiosyncrasies, poor performance and that it encourages bad programming practice. Some simply said they would recommend other software over R or they may recommend R, depending on why their friend or colleague wanted to learn a programming language.\nWhen asked to pick a single reason for recommending R, nearly 40% (160 of 425) said it was good for statistical analysis. R has long been described as the lingua franca of statistics or data science, so this makes sense. The next biggest reason was that it was good for reproducible research, indicating the increasing importance that has been put on this topic in recent years. Other important features are the package ecosystem, strength at visualization and the fact that it is free and open source."

    "text": "Moving Forward\n\nOutreach to under-represented groups\nAs the R community seeks to be more inclusive of under-represented groups we need to be aware that individuals from these groups are less likely to have a programming background and may have less freedom to spend time on unpaid and recreational contributions. Given R’s strength as a tool for statistical analysis, introductions to R should focus on this rather than the nuts and bolts of the language, as a general rule. More experienced R programmers from under-represented groups may need additional support to transition to developeRs – even when writing packages in pure R, concepts such as version control and object-oriented programming may be new and of course interfacing with other languages such as C++ is a further stretch. We should seek to promote opportunities to under-represented groups that are paid and/or will benefit their career, e.g. Google Summer of Code projects, useR! diversity scholarships, professional development via R-ladies groups, developing a package with rOpenSci, publishing in The R Journal and so on.\n\n\nTaskforce initiatives\nFollowing our recent call to join Forwards we have set up a number of sub-teams to support women and other under-represented groups in the R community. In particular the teaching team will focus on more inclusive pedagogy, such as using examples to engage a wider demographic, and running workshops for women and girls. We have also set up a community team, to look at ways to reach out to under-represented groups and an on-ramps team to look at ways to help useRs transition to developeRs. These are all new initiatives, but we hope to get some projects off the ground in all these areas in the coming year. Anyone wishing to get involved can contact us at rowforwards at gmail dot com.\n\n\nFurther research\nSome interesting questions for further research on useRs relationship with R include:\n\nWhat programming experience do people have before using R? For example, what languages did people learn before R?\nWhy do people write packages but not publicly release them? For example, are the packages for their own use (work/recreation), for internal company use, or are the packages in development? One respondent commented that their employer prohibited releasing packages on CRAN; how widespread is this?\nWhat are the pros and cons of using R? Several respondents commented that R has many benefits but also some drawbacks and richer data could be collected on this topic."

    "text": "R-Ladies in Africa\nThe set-up of a Cape Town chapter of R-Ladies was inspired by the first satRday conference in Cape Town. All three plenary speakers at that conference were part of the R-Ladies community and it was extremely refreshing to go to a conference largely about science and technology where women took the centre stage. Cape Town is a multicultural, multilingual and multiracial city, but this diversity is not represented in the R user community. The aim of the Cape Town chapter of R-Ladies is to grow the female R user community in Cape Town and bring to it the diversity of cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds present in the city. By the end of 2017 the group will have had five meetups since their launch in July this year. They are still quite a small group, but they are confident they will grow in time. One might expect that there would be many more people using R in a big city, but issues with congestion and public transport may form a barrier to people attending. The answer might be to form even more R-Ladies chapters around different parts of the city so that people don’t have to travel far! R-Ladies Cape Town can be reached at capetown at rladies dot org and on Twitter @RLadiesCapeTown.\nR Ladies Addis was founded on October 30, 2017 in the course of the 2nd Data Carpentry Workshop in Addis Ababa, with 7 founding members and 2 honorary members. Thanks to the support provided by Ms. Anelda van der Walt from South Africa, an honorary member of R Ladies Addis as well as the R Ladies community, R Ladies Addis got ready for its first meeting on November 14, 2017. The agenda of this meeting was to decide the framework of R Ladies Addis activities. The group has set its special focus on working with women students and women researchers by offering R training and R competitions. R Ladies Addis has been invited to reach out to the different corners of Ethiopia. For the time being R Ladies is present at https://r-ladies-addis.github.io/studyGroup and can be reached by e-mail addisababa at rladies dot org.\n 1st Meeting of R Ladies Addis on Nov. 14, 2017\nA new chapter of R-Ladies will soon be starting in Cotonou, Benin. The organizers plan to have their first meeting in January to conincide with the start of the new academic year. Follow the group on Twitter, @RLadiesCtn or email cotonou at rladies dot org to find out more! Local R-Ladies also hope to establish groups in Fez, Morocco and Johannesburg, South Africa; if you are interested in these groups, or interested in starting a chapter in your own area (in Africa or beyond!) you can contact info at rladies dot org."

The &gt;eR-Biostat initiative is focused on providing R-based materials for higher education programs in Biostatistics/Statistics, as well as introductory materials for non-statisticians and in future, an E-learning system for courses at different education levels.\nCourses are organized in four clusters and are ready to be delivered in class. The Introductory courses aim to train students in data analysis using R at a basic level. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both non-statisticians and statisticians. The courses within this cluster can also be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate programs in biostatistics/statistics. The Basic courses are designed for an intermediate level and a basic knowledge in statistics is required in order to follow the courses. The courses within this cluster can be used as training courses for non-statisticians and as courses to support R usage in undergraduate programs in biostatistics/statistics. The Statistical modelling (I) and Statistical modelling (II) clusters consist of basic and advanced courses, respectively, at master’s level in biostatistics/statistics.\n The first &gt;eR-Biostat workshop in Gondar University, Ethiopia\nCourse materials and updated information about our activities are available online (See &gt;eR-BioStat).\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter (@erbiostat).

    "title": "Emily Robinson, from Social Scientist to Data Scientist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Maëlle Salmon, a Forwards collaborator, got the chance to interview Emily Robinson, who recently became a data analyst at Etsy. A very inspiring R-Lady!\n\nHi, Emily! Thanks for letting us interview you! You studied Decision Sciences at Rice University and then graduated from INSEAD with a Master’s degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). What are those fields? How do they help you today?\nDecision Sciences was an interdisciplinary major I actually created at Rice in my sophomore year based on Carnegie Mellon’s major. Before then I’d been planning to major in economics or psychology, but I found that neither really satisfied what I was looking for: to understand how people make decisions. So I decided to take the rarely used option at Rice to design my own curriculum with the input of many faculty members, and I created a course list that was a mix of economics, psychology, statistics, and philosophy.\nOrganizational Behavior is a pretty broad field, but essentially is the application of sociology and psychology applied to organizations/work. So people study everything from the effect of power on behavior to the benefits and pitfalls of multicultural teams to how social activists affect corporate political activity. I focused more on the micro (psychology) side and studied women in STEM fields.\nAll of the statistics courses I took have definitely helped. Also, the data science project process is actually quite similar to social sciences research: you come up with a question or a hypothesis, gather and clean the data, run an analysis, and communicate your findings.\nFinally, I think there’s often a place for knowledge about human and organizational behavior to come into the data science research process. I talked a lot in my interviews about how social sciences knowledge could be used in designing experiments; for example, the fact that giving people more choices actually makes them less likely to buy something, or that people from different countries use satisfaction scales differently (e.g. an American and a German may be equally satisfied with a product, but because of cultural reasons the German gives a lower score on a scale out of 10).\nYou then decided to become a data scientist instead. What motivated this decision? (Also, note we now assume you make decisions in a smarter way than most of us, given the name of your college major!)\nShort answer: I felt data science was where the most interesting questions, tools, and data were. I also believe that working as a data scientist/analyst offers a bigger possibility for broad impact than academia. While there’s definitely a lot of interesting and important research being done in academia, it’s a very long, slow process, with a lot of luck, and often times doesn’t reach anyone outside of the ivory tower. If anyone wants the longer story, please feel free to reach out to me on twitter/email.\nWhen did you first come in contact with R? Was it love at first sight? From which point did you feel enough at ease to be not only a R user, but also a R programmer?\nI was very lucky to do my undergraduate degree at Rice University, where at the time Hadley Wickham was a Statistics Professor. I only took one course with him, an Introduction to Statistics course, which didn’t involve R, but he had also designed later courses that were taught by his graduate students. At the time I didn’t realize how prominent in the R community he was, despite my brother Dave Robinson (then a PhD student at Princeton, now a data scientist at StackOverflow) shouting at me how cool it was that I was being taught by Hadley.\nBecause the courses were so well-designed and taught, I definitely fell in love with R at first sight. Despite its reputation as having a steep learning curve, I found it fairly straight forward to pick up (or maybe I’m just romanticizing it in my memories). That being said, I didn’t use it much outside of my statistics courses that required it, except to make a few plots for one of my research projects. It was in graduate school that I started to use R of my own volition. As I wrote about in one of my blog posts, I got so frustrated with using STATA, the language of choice for my graduate program, for certain class assignments that I switched to using R.\nI think this transition from being an R user to R programmer was also helped by some new tidyverse packages that came out in the last few years, especially dplyr. While the packages I initially learned, like reshape2 and plyr, were great, R has clearly advanced in the four years since I did most of my R courses.\nWhat is this program you’ve done for transitioning into your new career and how did you hear about it? How much can one learn in 12 weeks?\nMetis is a Data Science Bootcamp that helps people transition into careers as a Data Scientist/Analyst. I heard about it from my brother, who had spoken at Metis and gone to their career day, where students present their final projects to recruiters and data scientists. He had been really impressed by the quality of the students and their work, and so I looked into the program more. I found that it fit perfectly my background, as what I was missing was Python skills and Machine Learning knowledge. Metis is not meant to take you from 0 to 60; everyone who enters the program has some knowledge of statistics and programming, although their backgrounds still vary widely. In my cohort, we had people a few years out of college, one person with twenty years of marketing experience, and a few with PhDs in quantitative fields.\n Emily’s Metis cohort plus the two instructors (two people on the right)\nIn terms of what you can learn in 12 weeks, Metis is not meant to make you an expert in everything they cover. Rather, by giving you exposure to many topics and having you do projects around them, you get a good enough grounding so that you can continue learning on your own. It also gives you a portfolio of projects that you can host on your GitHub and talk about during interviews. The other big benefit is the career support from the Metis career team and from the extensive alumni network. You receive help in making a resume and prepping for interviews, but also in connecting you to people at the companies you’re interested in. For me it was 100% worth it. It was also a lot of fun and I met some great people!\nYou had to use Python at Metis: Which language do you use the most now? Could you use only Python?\nSince I just started my position, I’m not sure which language I’ll be using more. Etsy is pretty agnostic for which language its analysts use, and a lot of the work is done in SQL since we are working with such big datasets. If I had too, I could definitely use only Python, since I did use it so intensely for those few months. But I’m still definitely biased towards R and will probably be using that more.\nYou have just started a job at Etsy as a data scientist (congrats!). Could you tell us a little bit more about your job there? What kind of problems do you solve? How is the work organized between members of your team?\nThank you! My official title is actually Data Analyst and I’m on the analytics team; Data Scientists at Etsy are on the engineering (production) side and generally have PhDs in Computer Science/Machine Learning or similar backgrounds. While the analytics team sits together, we are embedded with other teams and serve as a sort of consultant, helping those teams improve how they use and analyze their data, run experiments, etc. For example, we have analysts working with marketing, accounting, seller services, etc.\nI’ll be working on search, which I’m very excited about since search is such a big part of the Etsy experience. Etsy actually just acquired BlackBird Technologies and their team to bring AI into their search, which should offer a lot of new opportunities. I’ll be working closely with another senior analyst and the broader search sciences team.\nThat all being said, Etsy does a great job with orientation and the first few weeks are dedicated to meeting people, reading analytics on-boarding materials, and getting my tech stack set up. So I haven’t heard anything yet about what specific projects I’ll be working on and won’t for a little while.\nWhat would you wish to have known sooner on your way to become a data scientist?\nDon’t be intimidated! It’s easy to feel like unless you have a PhD in Machine Learning and are an expert in Big Data that there are no roles for you. This isn’t helped by the fact that some companies’ job postings read like a wish list for a Data Scientist unicorn. But if you’ve been working on building your skills, you can find a position for you. You also DO NOT need to necessarily meet all of the job requirements; don’t be afraid to apply to a job where you’re just missing one of multiple criteria, or you have a year or two fewer years of experience than they mention.\nAnd as with almost every job, networking is critical. At some companies, there are thousands of people applying for each position, and having someone refer you can really help you get your foot in the door. Even more than that, talking to someone about the culture and day-to-day work in a company will really help you in your interview, because you’ll know more about what they’re looking for and if you’re a good fit.\nFinally, don’t be hung up on titles and only focus on positions where the title is “Data Scientist”. The work you’re doing is what’s important, and some data analysts are doing work that at other companies would be classified as a data scientist job. My title is a Data Analyst (as was Hilary Parker’s when she started out at Etsy), and while I’m not going to be doing deep learning projects anytime soon, I don’t think there’s going to be any shortage of interesting and challenging work.\nYou mention the importance of giving back to the open-source community on your blog, Hooked on Data. What are your plans with the blog and your programming in general? (Please keep writing on your blog!)\nOne big thing I want to do is host some in-person R tutorials for the R-Ladies NYC group. They had their kick-off meeting a few weeks ago, and many people expressed interest in an introduction to R tutorial and a more advanced one. While there are definitely some good resources online, my favorites are DataCamp for interactive tutorials and Hadley and Garrett’s new R for Data Science book, I do think it can sometimes be easier to learn in person. I tried to get more people in my graduate program (including professors!) to use R, so I’d love to help a group that already recognizes the value of R and is eager to learn.\nOther than that, I definitely want to keep blogging. I think a lot of my work at Etsy is going to be confidential, so I won’t be able to share that, but hopefully I’ll be able to talk about some cool side projects I’m doing or general principles I learned from my work. I’ve promised posts about making my first R package and my final Metis project, so I’d better get going on those!\nP.S. DataCamp has a few free courses, but if anyone wants to try unlimited access you can do so for free for two days with this link. There’s some really great courses, including one by Hadley and his sister Charlotte, and another by my brother!\nLast but not least, we were thrilled to learn you are a RCatLady although you don’t have a cat! Also you have a dog! Is she a good R-Dog?\n Emily’s R-Dog Abby\nShe is the best R-Dog. I’m very excited that Etsy is a dog-friendly office, and I plan to take her into the office sometime soon. I’m sure she’ll be very well-behaved; she spends most days sleeping on her bed or sitting under my mom’s desk at home right by her feet.\nOkay now we are very jealous! Thanks again Emily for talking with us, all the best for the future!\nContact Emily via her email address (robinson.es at gmail dot com), go read her blog, follow her on Twitter, Github, or LinkedIn.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this interview represent Emily’s own views and opinions, not necessarily those of Etsy.\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"

    "text": "Every year, hundreds of R programmers descend on a host city and spend three or four days sharing work, collaborating on projects and making new contacts - the useR! conference, this year held in Stanford, CA. useR! offers a wonderful opportunity to map a subset of the language’s most active users and the Women in R Task Force took this opportunity to survey attendees and find out their backgrounds, experiences and interests, in the hope that it will help us to get a better understanding of how to make the R community a more inclusive environment.\nOur survey received 455 responses, out of 899 attendees, and appears to represent the attendees pretty accurately.1 In this blog post, we’ll step through the attendees’ demographic background, how that represents the wider scientific and computing communities (and wider world), and propose recommendations for ways to bring these demographics towards parity."

    "text": "Summary\nSurvey responses showed that attendees were largely male and white, with Latinx, Native American and people of African descent particularly under-represented. Attendees were almost all employed, and what’s more, employed in a permanent, full-time job. Attendence skewed heavily towards people in their late 20s and early to mid 30s, with men tending to be older than women, and attendees largely coming from the United States and almost exclusively from North American and Western European countries.\nOur recommendations are that, going forward, useR! conferences set aside tickets and funding for under-represented groups, and put resources into facilities such as feeding rooms and childcare that would benefit caregivers with small children, many of whom are women. Additionally, the Task Force itself will be refocusing its efforts and mission to emphasise the intersectional nature of marginalisation that women face, in line with the dispiriting results around race, employment and educational attainment. We will also be running further surveys to build up a better idea of the “ground truth” of the R community, and to track improvements and suggestions on an ongoing basis."

    "title": "Mapping useRs",
    "section": "Survey results",
    "text": "Survey results\n\nGender and race\nThe gender breakdown of responses (n=453) showed that approximately 33% of attendees identified as women, with the majority of the remainder identifying as men and a small number identifying outside the gender binary.\nWhile the inclusion of women is not as bad as at other conferences, it’s also definitely lower than it could be given that there are many scientific fields - such as biology, which R is particularly commonly used in - where women outnumber men in terms of degree attainment.2 At the same time, some of this may be offset by the location and chosen topics for presentations, which were more focused on visualisation or computing than biostatistics.\nRace is more complicated, because there’s more variation in the answers - as intended! Both race and gender questions were offered as a free text field to avoid restricting respondents to false dichotomies. One side-effect, though, is that it’s hard to aggregate the data. What we can say, though, is:\n\n74% of respondents identified as White or Caucasian;\n16% fell within the US Federal guidelines for ‘Asian’, or identified directly as Asian;\n3% identified as Hispanic or Latinx;\n1% identified as people of African descent;\n0.5% identified as Native American or Pacific Islander;\n0.25% identified as Middle Eastern and\n3% identified as mixed-race.\n\nIn comparison, a survey of STEM workers in the United States found 6% were Black and 7% Hispanic3 4 - and the overall demographics of the United States point even more clearly to an under-representation of non-Asian minority groups.5 The response rate was somewhat lower on this question (n = 409), perhaps due to concerns about identifiability. Nonetheless, there’s clearly work to be done.\n\n\nLGBT\n5% of respondents identified as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Transgender. How this maps to overall industry, academic and population trends is hard to identify, because the long history of persecution of LGBT individuals and the often confusing and ill-defined nature of identity means that the proportion of LGBT individuals is regularly under-reported. Attempts to control for that under-reporting have shown up to 19% of the U.S. population experience same-sex attraction,6 although more traditional methodologies suggest around 11%.7\nIt’s possible that the useR! survey is one of the surveys in which under-reporting is found - although 447 responses were received, which suggests people at least didn’t skip it - but it’s probably fair to say that such a sizeable difference in outcome is going to contain some genuine differences in population, as well as methodological variation.\nAdditionally, it is probable that the other demographics of LGBT attendees reflect the overall demographics of attendees, meaning that (for example) we would expect to find lesbians or bisexual women under-represented in that 5%.\n\n\nAge\nApproximating age (by subtracting the year of birth from 2016) shows the following:\n\nWomen trend younger than men at the conference, but the age distribution is similar across the two genders; 47% of respondents (n = 438) were born in the 1980s - in other words, were people in their late 20s to mid 30s. This lines up neatly with the education data (more on that later) and suggests that people in their early 20s and 40+ year olds are not finding the conference appealing - because there are other things to spend time on, because money is tighter, or for some other reason.\nThe women-being-younger element suggests that the rise in women attending (compared to 2015, where the proportion of women was only 19%) represents younger or newer members of the community attending, too.\n\n\nGeography\nThe R community is a highly international one, with developers in a wide range of countries. One of the things we were interested to discover is how this comes out in the attendee mix at useR!. Accordingly, we asked attendees which country they currently resided in.\nAltogether, R programmers from 34 nations attended useR!, but the overwhelming majority of respondents (71% of n = 443) live in the United States. In some ways this isn’t surprising - the cost of getting to Stanford increases the further away you are, and it’s expensive to start with! - and the rotation of the conference between continents each year means that many non-US R programmers are likely to simply attend the next European event. At the same time, it’s still somewhat disappointing for an event considered the “main” R conference, particularly with only ~20 attendees coming from Canada, a country bordering the U.S.\n\n\n\nEducation\nThe vast majority of attendees (&gt;85%, of n = 451) had completed postgraduate degrees:\n\n\n\nHighest Qualification Completed\nWomen (%)\nMen (%)\n\n\n\n\nProfessional degree or certification\n1.2\n2.8\n\n\nDoctorate\n41.7\n45.7\n\n\nMasters degree\n42.9\n40.4\n\n\nUndergraduate degree\n13.7\n10.3\n\n\nHigh school/Secondary school or lower\n0.6\n0.7\n\n\n\nThis further suggests, on top of the data around age, that the conference is not attracting younger and more-early-career R programmers and researchers. Part of this may simply be that spending money on an R conference may be a lot easier to justify when you’re in full-time employment, or in a postgraduate degree with a stipend, than as an undergraduate or masters student; part of it is probably also that people without degrees, or without postgraduate degrees, earn less money and may come from poorer backgrounds, extending the problem.\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that the concept of research conferences as places to attend is not something particularly pushed on undergraduates, and so there is a component of awareness as well as finance. Finally, it may simply be that the conference is very academia-oriented, and so is particularly attractive to academics (and those familiar with academia) rather than R programmers without an academic background.\nAs the age data suggests, women tend to be slightly earlier on in the traditional academic career path.\n\n\nProfessional environment\nAlmost all of the attendees were employed, which (with the cost of the tickets) makes sense. More interestingly, a majority of the attendees (~57% of n = 444) were employed outside academia, primarily by private sector organisations. This is a strong indicator of what we’ve known anecdotally for a while - that R, a language originally designed and used in academia, is becoming more prevalent outside that context. At the same time, this may be a (somewhat) localised effect: while the language is increasingly popular, the technology industry centred on Silicon Valley is certainly an outlier in many respects for research overall.\n\nAnother interesting takeaway was that men are more likely to work in industry and permanent academic jobs than women - and women are far, far more likely to be students. Again, this isn’t surprising since it fits the pattern that women attending tend to be younger than men, and overall patterns that the tech industry (which is where one would expect the majority of privately-employed R programmers and scientists to work) has a known problem with employing and promoting women, as does academia.\nAlmost all attendees work full-time. It’s difficult to tell if this is due to the wider community largely being employed or engaged in full-time activities, or due to the cost of attendance diminishing the ability of community members in more economically fragile situations such as part-time work or unemployment to attend. Female attendees were less likely to work part-time, and far more likely to identify their status as unemployed (although the sample size is too small to really draw conclusions):\n\n\n\nEmployment Status\nWomen (%)\nMen (%)\n\n\n\n\nFull-time\n92.2\n94.3\n\n\nPart-time\n1.8\n4.3\n\n\nI am not currently employed\n6.0\n1.4\n\n\n\nThe proportion identifying as unemployed is greater than the proportion that previously identified as unemployed or retired, which could indicate that some students are categorising themselves as ‘not in employment’ when not presented with an option that reflects student-status.\n\n\nCaregiving\nApproximately a quarter of respondents answered “yes” to the question “are you a caregiver for children or adult dependents on a regular basis?” (n = 445). More men than women identified as caregivers. This either indicates that R programmers are a singularly socially enlightened population, or reflects wider sociological conditioning around caregiving which makes it easier for men to leave children at home with their partner (if applicable) than for women to do the same - resulting in a self-selection effect in which women with children are less likely to be able to attend (and so women who do attend are less likely to have children they care for).\nQualitative data suggests, unsurprisingly, the latter - in the free-text field for the survey, several (female) respondents mentioned the difficulty of persuading their (male) partners to handle childcare to allow them to attend conferences.\n\n\n\nCaregiving Status\nWomen (%)\nMen (%)\n\n\n\n\nNo\n78.3\n71.2\n\n\nYes\n21.7\n28.8"

    "section": "Recommendations",
    "text": "Recommendations\n\nConference proposals\nThe survey data surfaces a lot of problems that can be tackled directly by future useR! conferences, and other conferences in the field too. In particular, it shows that while the gender breakdown of the conference is not as bad as we might fear, it’s still lagging behind the general population of the scientific fields R programming draws from, as well as the population as a whole. In addition, and in some ways more worryingly, attendees are overwhelmingly white, with Native Americans, Latinx people and people of African descent particularly under-represented.\nThese problems won’t be solved overnight, but there are several things the conference can do that would make attending a more viable and enjoyable prospect for under-represented groups. These include:\n\nA wider scholarship system. useR! 2016 featured scholarships, helping pay for things like plane tickets or hotels for people from marginalised backgrounds who wished to attend. The committee tasked with allotting the money did excellent work, but the money available was small. Expanding the scholarship fund in future conferences would let more under-represented R programmers attend, going a long way towards making a more representative conference.\nChildcare and feeding support. One of the things we saw in qualitative data, and something the quantitative data points to, is that the difficulties of juggling childcare is a blocker on attendance, particularly for women. Providing subsidised or free childcare at the conference itself (along with breastfeeding rooms), and incorporating childcare into the scholarship system, would help with this, and has been successfully done elsewhere.8\nStaggered ticket release. useR! 2016 sold out incredibly quickly, with all of the tickets gone within a day. This made it difficult for people to attend if they weren’t extremely on the ball and able to decide, on or before the first registration day, that they wanted to attend. By definition this hurts marginalised people because it hurts people who, for financial reasons, need to put some energy behind working out if they can attend. One solution worth considering is staggering the release of tickets over several days or weeks - perhaps with a waiting or notification list. This offers potential attendees multiple opportunities, reducing the penalty paid for not being ready to go on day 1.\nA more precise code of conduct. Following an open letter in 2015 the R Foundation adopted a resolution that any Foundation-affiliated conference have a Code of Conduct,9 which we applaud. What that code contains, however, in terms of restrictions, the amount of information given to attendees, and the enforcement mechanisms and their ease of use, is largely left up to the individual conference instance. This creates inconsistency and uncertainty for both attendees and conference organisers. Selecting a specific code of conduct, with a specific enforcement mechanism, along with training for enforcers, would solve for much of this, and give concerned attendees more certainty that the conference is a safe place to be.\n\n\n\nTask Force proposals\nThis survey has also helped to shape the goals of the Task Force on Women in the R Community. In particular, focusing in women, as a catchall, is not enough. Issues such as race, sexuality, disability and class intersect with gender and must also be considered if we are to build an R community that is more representative of the scientific/software communities and of society as a whole.\nAccordingly we are rebranding the Task Force as simply Forwards, so that we can consider the needs of other marginalised groups as part of our mission. Our primary focus will still be on women as there remains much work to do here and broadening participation of women was the motivation for setting up the task force. However many of the practical actions we can take, such as the proposals above, will also impact other marginalised groups and making this impact a formal part of our mission will help to ensure our actions do not only benefit white, highly educated women.\nAs an immediate consequence, we will be publishing an open call for participation, seeking more members for the group. We are particularly interested in talking to volunteers from non-White, LGBT, non-middle-class or early career backgrounds.\nRunning this survey has also served to reinforce that we have no fundamental ground truth here; it is hard to see what the backgrounds of those who try but fail to attend useR are, and their reasons for not going - it is hard to see what the demographics of R community members overall look like. Accordingly we will be running further surveys, adjusting several questions to factor in things we’ve learned from running this one, looking at the overall community and useR! attendees in a more nuanced way."

A third of useRs attend a local user group, although the proportion is higher among men than women. The main reasons for not attending are there is no group nearby, or people are too busy. The top initiatives that would encourage more involvement are a new user group nearby and mentoring. Women are more likely than men to want additional support and are more in favour of online support and initiatives targeted at their demographic.\nThe respondents had many suggestions for improving the R community and these along with the other survey responses provide a basis for Forwards and other R community leaders to work towards greater engagement."

There was no significant difference in responses from men and women.\nIt’s encouraging that such a large proportion feel part of the R community: as might be expected the proportion increased with the length of time the respondent had used R, yet even people with less than 6 months’ experience responded positively.

    "text": "Conclusions\nIt has taken us a while to work through the survey and report back. However a benefit of this is we can see that actions in the meantime by Forwards and the wider community are already starting to address many of the issues raised in the last part of the survey.\nThe massive expansion of R-Ladies over the past year (from 4 groups to over 452) means that many people who were looking for a group now have one nearby, or will have soon. Many of the suggestions for useR! are in place for useR! 2017: there will be a newbies session, childcare and a “hackathon space” for informal birds of a feather gatherings. In addition 26 participants were awarded diversity scholarships (thanks to the conference sponsors, especially platinum sponsors Microsoft, Open Analytics, R Consortium, RStudio, DataCamp, and IBM).\nWith regards to education and outreach, the Forwards Teaching sub-team were recently awarded an R Consortium grant to develop workshops specifically targeting women and high school girls - initial workshops are planned for September and December in Melbourne, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand respectively. Further workshops will be run in Europe and the US, and the material made available under a Creative Commons share-alike license for others to use.\nBeyond this, we can use the ideas and findings here to inform future initiatives. For example the Forwards Community sub-team can help to promote local groups by raising awareness, connecting people that want to start new groups and sharing ideas to increase participation. In line with our mission to increase participation among under-represented groups, we can focus on initiatives that appear to be particularly appealing to women, such as mentoring and an online forum.\nOverall we have learnt a lot from our survey of useR! participants. In future we would like to study other populations and have package authors in mind for our next big survey. However, we still wish to monitor participation of under-represented groups at useR! so will be running a demographic survey as part of the general conference evaluation survey at useR! 2017. If you’re coming to useR! please support us by responding!"

    "text": "On September 8, 2019, Samantha Toet and Angela Li co-taught a 3-hour Forwards Package Development Workshop at a weekend R-Ladies Charlottesville Meetup.\nThe workshop took place as a result of Angela being in town - she reached out to Sam and suggested the workshop, Sam thought it was a good idea, and they worked together to coordinate the logistics (all Sam!) and teaching. By using the Forwards curriculum and pre-made organizing templates - with a few tweaks of their own, of course - they were able to pull together the workshop in a month.\nThe workshop was an abbreviated version of the full Forwards curriculum that allowed participants to develop their first-ever package. The workshop started with motivating the need to create a package, then walked through making a package from scratch, then went over best practices and sharing out a package. We thought it was a good “story arc” for participants: create, document, test, and share.\nWe enjoyed teaching the workshop, and there were several things we learned from teaching it:\n\nLet them eat cake (first), or have participants create and explore their own package, no matter how small it is. You can help with some of the heavy lifting by providing sample functions to use in the package, but give them ownership of the full process.\nMistakes are good! Coding is never perfect or streamlined, so by troubleshooting on the spot, you’re demonstrating the iterative process. For example, Sam started off her session by live troubleshooting a Roxygen tagging issue. Participants could call out their suggestions and collaboratively come to a solution. Participants were also able to get a real taste of the process of looking at help pages, changing some part of the code, re-documenting and building the package, and looking at the results.\nFocus on workflows and process over exact tooling. The goal of this workshop was not to make every participant an expert package developer, but help participants see the patterns of package development. By internalizing these patterns (for example, modify code -&gt; load -&gt; explore in console, or write tests -&gt; modify code -&gt; load), participants are able to understand the general workflow and start to ask deeper questions and explore more on their own.\n\nIf you’re interested in organizing an R-Ladies based workshop of your own, you can use the resources we developed. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to either of us for more information - we’d be happy to chat (or maybe even co-teach)!\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"

    "text": "Using the satRday Johannesburg 2020 conference as a springboard, Forwards set up a project to help build the R community in Southern Africa. With funding from the Why R? Foundation, the R Consortium and a crowd-funding campaign, Forwards collaborated with local R users to run a series of training and community events in South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana. All the events promoted AfricaR, the pan-African network of R users, to help raise awareness of this community among R users in Southern Africa.\n\nSouth Africa\nThe events began with Heather Turner assisting Bianca Peterson in running her 2-day Introduction to R Workshop hosted by PwC, Midrand.\n Bianca Peterson with participants at the Introduction to R workshop, Johannesburg\nThis event was attended by over 20 participants, mostly from local businesses and organizations. Although Bianca and Heather were there because of the satRday, most of the participants were new to R and only came to the workshop. This demonstrates the potential for conferences to facilitate outreach events that grow the community. Due to fantastic support of the crowd-funding campaign, Forwards was able to award a scholarship to Ofentse Phuti-Rice, a Computer Science MSc student from Botswana. The scholarship enabled her to attend this workshop, the Web Scraping with R pre-satRday workshop led by Megan Beckett and Andrew Collier, and the satRday itself.\nAfter the Introduction to R workshop, Heather joined fellow satRday keynote Colin Fay to speak at R-Ladies Johannesburg. Colin spoke on how to contribute to the R ecosystem - everything from sharing what you’re learning to writing a package - while Heather spoke about publishing and promoting your packages. This time the dozen or so attendees were R enthusiasts, most of whom would be at the satRday workshops and/or conference.\n The folks at R-Ladies Johannesburg\nThe satRday workshops were the following day. Heather led a workshop using the latest iteration of the Forwards package development slides, with Bianca assisting. The workshop was open to all, however funding from the R Consortium supported scholarships for four women to attend: Astrid Radermacher, a postdoc at the University of Cape Town; Lillian Pazvakawambwa, a lecturer at the University of Namibia; Fransina Amutenya, a statistician at Namibia Statistics Agency and Caroline Akoth, Advocacy and Operations Lead, Women in GIS, Kenya. The scholarship enabled the recipients to attend the satRday conference as well as the workshop.\n Heather Turner leading the R Package Development workshop, Johannesburg.\nThe satRday itself was attended by over 100 people, with many folk travelling from across South Africa and beyond to attend.\n Participants waiting for the programme to start at satRday Johannesburg.\nThere was a packed programme of 2 keynote talks, 13 regular talks and 8 lightning talks - there are links to slides and videos in the programme. Heather gave a talk on Diversity and Inclusion in the R Community (Video, Slides), focusing on outreach to underrepresented groups beyond white women and the path to becoming an R (core) developer. The conference was also a great opportunity for networking, particularly among people from different cities/countries.\n Emmanuel Ọlámíjùwọ́n, co-organizer of Eswatini UseR group, with Heather Turner, satRday Johannesburg.\n\n\nEswatini\nAfter the satRday, Heather travelled to Eswatini to give a two-day workshop at the University of Eswatini, hosted by the Eswatini UseR group. Participants were mostly students/staff at the university, but a few came from outside organizations such as the revenue authority and a local non-profit. The workshop covered data import, data wrangling, data visualisation and linear modelling, and the participants created an R markdown report based on a case study.\n Participants at Introduction To R workshop, Eswatini, including two of the user group organizers at the back by the windows, L: Garikayi Chemhaka, R: Nontsikelelo Shongwe\nThere was a lot of interest in more advanced topics, such as handling missing data, working with big data and machine learning. At the end of the workshop, Heather gave a talk on the R Community and Free Resources so that participants would know how to get support and materials for further learning.\n Mbongeni Dube, co-organizer of Eswatini UseR group, outside the workshop venue.\n\n\nGaborone\nDue to a flight cancellation (unrelated to COVID-19), Heather was not able to visit Gaborone as planned. However the organizers from the new Botswana R Users group, along with co-organizers from WiMLDS Gaborone and PyData Botswana helped facilitate an Introduction to R tutorial, with Heather teaching remotely over Zoom. The tutorial gave a basic orientation of R/RStudio, before focusing on visualization with base R and ggplot2 (slides here, we skipped data wrangling).\nThe participants took some great photos, including our banner image and the one of women attendees below.\n Women that attended the Introduction To R workshop, Botswana.\nAfter the workshop, the Botswana R User group was officially launched. Heather gave her talk on the R Community and Free Resources, while Edson Kambeu gave an overview of the vision for the R User Group. Attendees took turns to introduce themselves: there were a number of students and people working as statisticians or data scientists; most people currently used SPSS or Python, but were interested to learn R.\n\n\nElsewhere\nThose are all the events that have taken place so far. The original aim was also to run a tutorial and launch a R User Group in Namibia. This proved to be too difficult to arrange to coincide with Heather’s visit to the area, but useful connections were made and organizers at the University of Namibia have applied for a grant from The R Consortium to help launch a user group. There is also some funding left over from the crowdfunder, which we hope to use to support a tutor from South Africa to lead a tutorial in Windhoek, when circumstances allow it. We have also made connections to people interested in R (and QGIS) training in Lesotho and hope to follow that up if we can.\n\n\nSummary\nWe’d like to thank all our supporters that made these events possible, especially the individuals that contributed to the crowdfunder. It was great that we were able to cover all the anticipated costs as well as fund some scholarships to the Johannesburg satRday and pre-conference workshops. The events helped to get many people started with R and hopefully inspired them to continue with it, supported by the local groups and wider community.\n\n\nPhoto credits\nPhotos from Gaborone by meetup attendees.\nPhoto of R-Ladies Johannesburg by Kirsty Lee Garson.\nPhoto of Eswatini UseR group by Emmanual Ọlámíjùwọ́n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nMCA summarizes the relationships between the categories of the R community variables.\n\nTo interpret the main dimensions of variability in the response profiles, we study the proximities between categories. Indeed, two categories are close on the graph if most respondents taking the first category also take the other category.\n\nFirst dimension of variability\nThe first dimension (horizontal axis) opposes people that didn’t answer questions about involvement in the R community on the left, to the others on the right. More precisely, they did not answer Q21, Q18 and Q20 and did not check any boxes for the other questions (_no). Individuals with the smallest coordinates on the first dimension work more in the industry; this is confirmed by a statistical test, but this remains difficult to interpret.\n\n\nSecond dimension of variability\nOn the top, there are respondents who do not attend an R user group because they feel too inexperienced. They think that they would be more likely to participate in the R community or to improve their experience, if a user group, a workshop, or an online support dedicated to their socio-demographic group would be available. Facebook would be their preferred medium for R community news. They do not use Twitter (question Q19_B), (the category R_twitter_no corresponds to the answer The #rstats hashtag on Twitter for the question Which of the following resources do you use for support?). In addition, they do not like to use it as a medium for R community news (question Q20). They consider themselves as outside the R community.\nOn the bottom, in contrast, there are individuals who tend to consider themselves as part of the R community. They attend general R user group meetings and they use Twitter. Twitter would be their preferred medium for R community news.\n\n\n\nRelationship with demographic\nIn the following graph, answers about the demographic questions are projected as supplementary variables on the two first dimensions of variability. Supplementary variables are not used to build the dimensions of variability, but they are projected a posteriori to highlight relationships between the dimensions of variability and demographics. Thus, supplementary variables can be used to characterize the response profiles described previously.\nOnly demographic characteristics that are significantly related the R community profiles are represented. An analysis of variance with demographic variables as covariates, and the coordinates of the individuals on the dimensions as explanatory variables, has been performed.\n\nIt appears that people having an undergraduate degree or a master degree are located at the top of the graph, while those with a doctorate are at the bottom. This would imply that people with undergraduate degree or master degree are more likely to consider themselves as outside the R community than people having a doctorate. The same comment holds for women versus men. It is interesting to note, caregivers for children or adult dependents tend to be at the bottom of the graph, while non-caregivers are on the top.\nWe represent the age categories on the map since some confounding effects with other demographic variables could explain the previous results. Youngest people tend to be on the top of the second axis, which suggests that they consider themselves as outside the community.\n\nTo get more insights into this possible confounder effect, we created a new variable sex-age and represent it:\n\nIt highlights that both young (men and women) and women do not consider themselves as part of the R community.\n\n\nSimilarities between respondents\nA clustering of the participants is performed from their answers to questions about their involvement in the R community. More precisely a hierarchical clustering is performed on the principal components of MCA. The rationale is to improve the stability of the clustering by building it from denoised data rather than from the original dataset1. Several rules can be used to select the number of components used for the clustering. Here we choose 44 dimensions which corresponds to 95% of the projected inertia (variance) of the data.\nThe number of clusters is chosen according to the barplot of the inertia gains which suggests a partition with 3 clusters. However, this clustering is not relevant since most of respondents are in the same group:\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nsize\n12\n425\n6\n\n\n\nWe investigate the number of respondents in each group according to the number of components used to build the clustering:\n\n\n\n\nclust1\nclust2\nclust3\nclust4\nclust5\nclust6\nclust7\n\n\n\n\nncp=2\n12\n307\n124\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=3\n12\n208\n162\n61\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=4\n12\n231\n139\n61\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=5\n12\n212\n148\n65\n6\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=6\n12\n249\n160\n22\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=7\n12\n269\n159\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=8\n12\n255\n173\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=9\n12\n236\n192\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=10\n12\n271\n157\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=11\n12\n273\n155\n3\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=12\n12\n428\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=13\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=14\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=15\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=16\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=17\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=18\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=19\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=20\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=21\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nncp=22\n12\n425\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nWe choose to keep 10 components as this will keep enough information, while highlighting a new cluster in the previous big one.\n\nRespondents are grouped in the clusters as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n%\n2.71\n61.17\n35.44\n0.68\n\n\n\n\nFrom the previous interpretation of the two first dimensions of variability, the location of clusters on the graph allows providing a brief summary of the clusters: cluster 1 is the group of non-respondents, while cluster 2 contains some respondents who feel they are part of the R community unlike the cluster 3 respondents.\n\nCluster 1\nTo describe the first cluster more precisely, we use statistical tests to compare the proportion of each category in the cluster against the proportion in the population of the respondents.\nUnsurprisingly, there is an over-representation of people that didn’t answer the questions about the involvement in the R community. Using the demographic characteristics, we can see that they are mainly from the industry.\n\n\nCluster 2\nThe following categories are over-represented in cluster 2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCla/Mod\nMod/Cla\nGlobal\np.value\n\n\n\n\nQ24=new_gp_near_no\n78.19\n92.62\n72.46\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ18=in_Rcommunity_yes\n70.64\n94.10\n81.49\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ21=Yes\n85.89\n51.66\n36.79\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ21_new=meeting_yes_A general user group\n86.82\n41.33\n29.12\n1.1e-13\n\n\nQ19_B=R_twitter_yes\n85.59\n37.27\n26.64\n3.4e-11\n\n\nQ24_C=free_workshop_no\n66.75\n94.10\n86.23\n3.1e-09\n\n\nQ20_new=medium_Twitter\n90.00\n23.25\n15.80\n8.3e-09\n\n\nQ19=R_mailing_yes\n73.89\n49.08\n40.63\n4.8e-06\n\n\nQ24_B=new_gp_demo_no\n64.08\n97.42\n93.00\n7.9e-06\n\n\nQ21_new=meeting_no_It is not necessary (I have the support I need)\n96.15\n9.23\n5.87\n3.5e-05\n\n\nQ24_D=paid_workshop_no\n64.92\n91.51\n86.23\n7.5e-05\n\n\nQ19_C=R_StackOverflow_yes\n66.17\n81.55\n75.40\n0.00020\n\n\nQ21_new=meeting_no_I am too busy\n77.92\n22.14\n17.38\n0.00071\n\n\nQ7=Doctorate\n68.91\n49.08\n43.57\n0.00334\n\n\nQ1_new=Q1_new_Academic/Govt\n69.02\n46.86\n41.53\n0.00428\n\n\nQ24_F=demo_workshop_no\n62.65\n97.79\n95.49\n0.00481\n\n\nQ9=Part-time\n93.33\n5.17\n3.39\n0.00648\n\n\nQ7=Professional degree or certification\n100.00\n3.69\n2.26\n0.00687\n\n\nQ19_L_new=web_no\n62.50\n97.79\n95.71\n0.00928\n\n\nQ24_K=online_demo_no\n62.35\n97.79\n95.94\n0.01753\n\n\nQ19_F=Biocond_yes\n80.65\n9.23\n7.00\n0.01900\n\n\nQ2Q3=&gt;58_Men\n85.00\n6.27\n4.51\n0.02259\n\n\nQ3_cat=&gt;58\n81.48\n8.12\n6.09\n0.02320\n\n\nQ2=Men\n65.22\n66.42\n62.30\n0.02582\n\n\nQ2Q3=29-33_Men\n74.14\n15.87\n13.09\n0.02851\n\n\n\nThe numbers read as follows, e.g. for Q18: 70.64% of individuals who consider themselves as part of the R community are in cluster 2; in cluster 2 94.1% of the individuals consider themselves as part of the R community, and 81.49% in the population of all the respondents consider themselves as part of the R community. The test is significant which implies that this cluster can be considered as a cluster with an over-representation of people considering themselves as part of the community. We conclude they are not interested in free workshops, online demos, etc. According to the demographic characteristics, there is an over-representation of people employed permanently in academia, people with caring responsibilities, as well as a significantly larger proportion of men and people with a doctorate.\nWe studied the categories under-represented in the cluster. However, since most of variables are binary, we do not get new information from this table. We note however that young people are under-represented, as well as people who didn’t participate in R user group meetings because of inexperience.\n\n\nCluster 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCla/Mod\nMod/Cla\nGlobal\np.value\n\n\n\n\nQ24=new_gp_near_yes\n81.97\n63.69\n27.54\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ21_new=meeting_no_There is no group nearby/the group is inactive\n78.82\n42.68\n19.19\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ21=No\n50.75\n86.62\n60.50\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nQ18=in_Rcommunity_no\n76.81\n33.76\n15.58\n2.4e-14\n\n\nQ24_C=free_workshop_yes\n73.77\n28.66\n13.77\n5.9e-11\n\n\nQ21_new=meeting_no_I feel too inexperienced\n90.32\n17.83\n7.00\n7.2e-11\n\n\nQ19_B=R_twitter_no\n43.69\n90.45\n73.36\n2.5e-10\n\n\nQ24_D=paid_workshop_yes\n62.30\n24.20\n13.77\n4.8e-06\n\n\nQ24_B=new_gp_demo_yes\n74.19\n14.65\n7.00\n6.9e-06\n\n\nQ20_new=medium_Website\n52.73\n36.94\n24.83\n1.8e-05\n\n\nQ19=R_mailing_no\n42.97\n71.97\n59.37\n5.6e-05\n\n\nQ19_L_new=web_yes\n68.42\n8.28\n4.29\n0.00351\n\n\nQ20_new=medium_Facebook\n66.67\n8.92\n4.74\n0.00351\n\n\nQ8=Q8_Employed in industry\n42.37\n47.77\n39.95\n0.01354\n\n\nQ3_cat=20-28\n45.83\n28.03\n21.67\n0.01803\n\n\nQ24_F=demo_workshop_yes\n60.00\n7.64\n4.51\n0.02503\n\n\nQ7=Undergraduate degree\n50.00\n15.92\n11.29\n0.02609\n\n\nQ24_K=online_demo_yes\n61.11\n7.01\n4.06\n0.02707\n\n\nQ2Q3=20-28_Women\n50.00\n15.29\n10.84\n0.02974\n\n\nQ20_new=medium_Google+\n100.00\n1.91\n0.68\n0.04396\n\n\nQ7=High school/Secondary school or lower\n100.00\n1.91\n0.68\n0.04396\n\n\n\nIn this cluster, there is an over-representation of those who adhere to most of the proposals to increase their participation in the R community. Most of them have never participated in a user group meeting. The cluster gathers a large number of people who use blogs to get help, but also a large proportion of people who do not use Twitter. They prefer to use a medium like Facebook or mailing lists for news.\nFrom a demographic point of view, the cluster contains a significantly higher proportion of women than the respondent population, and a larger proportion of those with a master’s or undergraduate degree. People under the age of 30 are also over-represented.\nNote that we need to be cautious concerning the interpretation of the clustering as it varies depending on the number of MCA components selected. The stability of the solution should be investigated further. In addition, the number of individuals per cluster may slightly vary as there is a “consolidation step”2 which is applied, i.e. a k-means algorithm applied after the hierarchical clustering."

    "section": "Other Issues to Consider",
    "text": "Other Issues to Consider\nThe following sections outline some other issues that we recommend organisers of useR! consider to encourage the participation of women.\n\nTutorials\nWe have not evaluated the proportion of women tutors at useR! conferences over the years, but note that 6/18 tutorials are being presented by women at useR! 2016. This is in line with the proportion of invited speakers, so seems a reasonable proportion to aim for. This may be hard to put into practice as tutorials are generally contributed rather than invited, however gender balance might be taken into account when ranking submissions or making a final selection.\n\n\nQuotas\nA large proportion of abstracts contributed to useR! are accepted in some form and there is no evidence of gender bias in the rejections or the assigned presentation format. Quotas might be considered in particular cases to encourage the participation of women. Lightning talks may be particularly suitable for this as the number of abstracts is often much greater than the number of slots. The following links provide good arguments for using quotas: http://womeninscienceaust.org/2015/11/15/achieving-gender-balance-in-less-than-3-years/; http://curt-rice.com/2014/07/03/2-ways-quotas-for-women-raise-quality/. Scope for using quotas may be limited by the gender balance in submitted abstracts: 50:50 may simply not be possible. Alternative actions to encourage the contribution of women might still be considered, e.g. favouring women presenters when ranking borderline abstracts.\n\n\nOutreach to Women\nEfforts should be made to attract women to the conference. An example from useR! 2016 was to email prominent female R users inviting them to the conference and asking them to encourage their colleagues/students, particularly women, to participate. Another idea might be to provide a template email at the end of the registration form to invite a colleague or friend to useR!, with an encouragement to reach out to potential female participants.\n\n\nLocal Groups\nIf there are local coding groups for women, it is worth considering whether these groups can be involved in any way. There might be a student society for women in computer science or an R-ladies group, for example.\n\n\nScholarships/Funding\nFunding obviously plays a large part in the ability of women to attend useR!. useR! 2016 is offering scholarships aimed at young researchers (funded by the American Statistical Association) and diversity scholarships aimed at minority groups such as LGBT people or people with disabilities, as well as women. Links to any external funding sources might be added to the conference website.\n\n\nChildcare/Family-friendliness\nThe family-friendliness of the conference should also be considered:\n\nIs childcare available on campus/at any of the hotels? Such information would be useful to put on the website.\nCould any sponsorship money be allocated to assistance with childcare?\nIs there any potential for a “family room” suitable for participants to take children where (the main) talks could be streamed?\nAre children welcome in sessions?"

    "section": "Reporting Back",
    "text": "Reporting Back\nWe hope that following the recommendations and considering the issues above will help to increase the participation of women in useR! conferences. To assist with this endeavour, conference organisers should share the outcomes of any initiatives to increase diversity. In particular, the gender of participants should be recorded to monitor the gender balance of attendees, invited speakers, presenters of contributed presentations/tutorials (broken down by presentation format), session chairs, and members of the local and program committees."
