Forwards, the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented 
groups, is seeking to address issues affecting under-represented groups
in general as it works to broaden the participation of women in the R 
community.

In order to adequately address such issues, we would like to widen the 
diversity of the taskforce itself. Accordingly, we are inviting people who are part of under-represented groups - be they groups identified by race, gender, sexuality, class or disability - to join us.

The taskforce has teleconferences once every two months, although as the 
taskforce is spread globally it isn't possible for all members to attend 
every time. Therefore online communication is also important and there are 
occasional meetings within subteams. Subteams work on specific tasks, such 
as data collection and analysis, social media, or working on recommendations
for R Foundation supported activities.

To express your interest or ask for further information, contact us at 
<rowforwards@gmail.com> by 31 January 2017.
