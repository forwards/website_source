Mathematical equations in form of LaTeX or MathML code can be rendered with the support of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). MathML works out of the box. If you're using LaTeX you need to wrap your equation with `$$` as shown in the following example:

<!--more-->

    $$ z = r \cdot (\sin{\phi} + \cos{\phi} \cdot i) $$

$$ z = r \cdot (\sin{\phi} + \cos{\phi} \cdot i) $$

You can also print formulas inline: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. In this case wrap the formula only once with `$`.
