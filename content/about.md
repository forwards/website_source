description: Background and structure of the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented groups

---

## Background

The task force was set up by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) in December 2015 to address the underrepresentation of women and rebranded in January 2017 to accommodate more under-represented groups such as LGBT, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities in the R community.

The members of the task force were invited to participate based on their interest in routing for specific under-represented groups and their contributions in the area of diversity and inclusion, to reflect different genders, ethnic groups, work contexts, career stages and aspects of the R project (e.g. CRAN and Bioconductor). The task force is organised as a core team plus a number of sub-teams that focus on particular tasks as outlined below:

* **Community**: General outreach to help people from under-represented groups get into R and develop as useRs.

* **Conferences**: Focusing on R Foundation conferences, liaising with organizers/program committee on policies and inclusion initiatives.

* **On-ramps**: Creating paths for useRs to develop their skills and make contributions to the R/BioConductor package ecosystem.

* **Social Media**: Posting to Twitter and/or Facebook, soliciting blog posts and publishing them, maintaining website. 

* **Surveys**: Running and analysing community surveys, packaging up data and tools and maintaining the [Data](https://forwards.github.io/data/) page.

* **Teaching**: Methodology, materials and workshops designed for under-represented groups. 

The activities of the taskforce are recorded in the [minutes of our bimonthly core team teleconferences and alternate monthly all team slackathons](https://github.com/forwards/meetings-public). We are open to new member joining one of our sub-teams. If interested, please contact <rowforwards@gmail.com>.

The task force is happy to engage with other individuals and organisations (such as [R-Ladies](http://r-ladies.org)) that are concerned about diversity and inclusion and actively seek outside collaboration on specific tasks.
