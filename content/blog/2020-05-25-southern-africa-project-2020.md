Using the [satRday Johannesburg 2020](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/) 
conference as a springboard, Forwards set up a project to help build the 
R community in Southern Africa. With funding from the [Why R? Foundation](http://whyr.pl/foundation/), 
the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) and 
a [crowd-funding campaign](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/forwards-southern-africa-project-2020), 
Forwards collaborated with local R users to run a 
series of training and community events in South Africa, Eswatini and 
Botswana. All the events promoted [AfricaR](https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers), 
the pan-African network of R users, to help raise awareness of this community 
among R users in Southern Africa.

# South Africa

The events began with Heather Turner assisting Bianca Peterson in running her 2-day 
[Introduction to R Workshop](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/introductory-r-workshop.html) hosted by PwC, Midrand.

This event was attended by over 20 participants, mostly from local businesses 
and organizations. Although Bianca and Heather were there because of the 
satRday, most of the participants were new to R and only came to the workshop. 
This demonstrates the potential for conferences to facilitate outreach events 
that grow the community. Due to fantastic support of the crowd-funding campaign, Forwards 
was able to award a scholarship to Ofentse Phuti-Rice, a Computer Science MSc 
student from Botswana. The scholarship enabled her to attend this workshop, 
the Web Scraping with R pre-satRday workshop led by Megan Beckett and 
Andrew Collier, and the satRday itself.

After the Introduction to R workshop, Heather joined fellow satRday keynote 
Colin Fay to speak at R-Ladies Johannesburg. Colin spoke on [how to contribute to the R ecosystem](https://speakerdeck.com/colinfay/contributing-to-the-r-ecosystem-0611f5a1-2d6e-4d19-951d-3181906ad61e) everything from sharing what you're learning to writing a package - while Heather spoke about [publishing and promoting your packages](https://www.heatherturner.net/talks/publishing-and-promoting-r-packages). 
This time the dozen or so attendees were R enthusiasts, most of whom would be 
at the satRday workshops and/or conference.

The satRday workshops were the following day. Heather led a workshop using the 
latest iteration of the [Forwards package development slides](https://forwards.github.io/edu/workshops/full_day_pkg_dev/), with 
Bianca assisting. The workshop was open to all, however funding from the R 
Consortium supported scholarships for four women to attend: Astrid Radermacher, 
a postdoc at the University of Cape Town; Lillian Pazvakawambwa, a lecturer at the University of Namibia; Fransina Amutenya, a statistician at 
Namibia Statistics Agency and Caroline Akoth, Advocacy and Operations Lead, Women in GIS, Kenya. The scholarship enabled the recipients to attend the satRday conference 
as well as the workshop.

The satRday itself was attended by over 100 people, with many folk travelling 
from across South Africa and beyond to attend.

There was a [packed programme](https://joburg2020.satrdays.org/#programme) 
of 2 keynote talks, 13 regular talks and 8 lightning talks - there are links 
to slides and videos in the programme. Heather gave a 
talk on Diversity and Inclusion in the R Community ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2_xhiO4rTY), [Slides](https://www.heatherturner.net/talks/satrdayjoburg2020/)), 
focusing on outreach to underrepresented groups beyond white women and the 
path to becoming an R (core) developer. The conference was also a great 
opportunity for networking, particularly among people from different 
cities/countries.

# Eswatini

After the satRday, Heather travelled to Eswatini to give a two-day workshop at 
the University of Eswatini, hosted by the [Eswatini UseR group](https://twitter.com/EswatiniUseR). Participants were mostly 
students/staff at the university, but a few came from outside organizations 
such as the revenue authority and a local non-profit. The workshop covered data 
import, data wrangling, data visualisation and linear modelling, and the 
participants created an R markdown report based on a case study.

There was a lot of interest in more advanced topics, such as 
handling missing data, working with big data and machine learning. At the end 
of the workshop, Heather gave a talk on the 
[R Community and Free Resources](https://www.heatherturner.net/talks/r-community) so that 
participants would know how to get support and materials for further learning.

# Gaborone

Due to a flight cancellation (unrelated to COVID-19), Heather was not able 
to visit Gaborone as planned. However the  organizers from the new 
[Botswana R Users](https://www.meetup.com/Botswana-R-Users/) group, along with 
co-organizers from [WiMLDS Gaborone](https://twitter.com/WiMLDS_Gaborone) and 
[PyData Botswana](https://twitter.com/PydataBW) helped facilitate an 
Introduction to R tutorial, with Heather teaching remotely over Zoom. The 
tutorial gave a basic orientation of R/RStudio, before focusing on 
visualization with base R and ggplot2 
([slides here](https://www.heatherturner.net/teaching/intro-to-r/), 
we skipped data wrangling).

The participants took some great photos, including our banner image and the one 
of women attendees below.

After the workshop, the Botswana R User group was officially launched. Heather 
gave her talk on the R Community and Free Resources, while Edson Kambeu gave 
an overview of the vision for the R User Group. Attendees took turns to 
introduce themselves: there were a number of students and people working as 
statisticians or data scientists; most people currently used SPSS or 
Python, but were interested to learn R. 

# Elsewhere

Those are all the events that have taken place so far. The original aim was 
also to run a tutorial and launch a R User Group in Namibia. This proved to 
be too difficult to arrange to coincide with Heather's visit to the area, but 
useful connections were made and organizers at the University of Namibia have 
applied for a grant from The R Consortium to help launch a user group. There is 
also some funding left over from the crowdfunder, which we hope to use to 
support a tutor from South Africa to lead a tutorial in Windhoek, when 
circumstances allow it. We have also made connections to people interested in 
R (and QGIS) training in Lesotho and hope to follow that up if we can.

# Summary

We'd like to thank all our supporters that made these events possible, 
especially the individuals that contributed to the crowdfunder. It was great 
that we were able to cover all the anticipated costs as well as fund some 
scholarships to the Johannesburg satRday and pre-conference workshops. 
The events helped to get many people started with R and hopefully inspired 
them to continue with it, supported by the local groups and wider community.
