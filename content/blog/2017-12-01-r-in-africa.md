## satRdays in Cape Town

Following the first successful [satRday in Budapest](http://budapest.satrdays.org/) on 3 September 2016, we hosted a [satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2017.satrdays.org/) on 18 February 2017. The event was held at [Workshop 17](http://workshop17.co.za/) in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. We had three great keynote speakers ([Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan), [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [Steph Locke](https://twitter.com/SteffLocke)). In addition to the invited speakers we received 41 contributed proposals, of which 23 were accepted: 3 tutorials, 8 standard talks and 12 lightning talks. Just over 200 tickets were issued for the event and the venue was literally packed. On two days prior to the conference there were workshops by the keynote speakers. These were also very well attended.

We are planning a second [satRday in Cape Town](http://capetown2018.satrdays.org/) on 17 March 2018. We are excited to have [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://twitter.com/maelle) and [Stephanie Kovalchik](https://twitter.com/StatsOnTheT) as keynote speakers. They will be presenting workshops on R package development and sports analytics with R on the day prior to the conference.

Next year's conference will be held at a bigger venue on campus of the University of Cape Town. So we will be able to accommodate even more enthusiastic R users. Tickets are on sale and the [Call for Papers](https://www.papercall.io/satrday-cape-town-2018) is open.

## Software/Data Carpentry

Since 2015 [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/) have been enabling R capacity development in Africa. Software and Data Carpentry host two-day workshops teaching researchers and postgraduate students foundational skills to assist with better research software development and data analysis respectively. The Carpentries are global non-profit volunteer organisations that not only teach tools like R, Python, SQL, and git/Github, but also run a two-day [instructor training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) to help technical experts teach more effectively.

![Highlights from Carpentry workshops](/images/blog/r-in-africa/carpentries.jpg)

Over the past three years more than 30 workshops were run in countries like [South Africa](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/05/instructor-training-south-africa.html), [Mauritius](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/mauritius.html), Ghana, [Gabon](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/mauritius.html), [Namibia](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/namibia.html), Botswana, [Kenya](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/tdwg/), and [Ethiopia](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/ethiopia.html). These workshops have reached hundreds of researchers and students who mostly had limited or no prior exposure to programming. 

More information about the lessons we teach is available at the websites: [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/).

Another outcome of several of the Carpentry workshops, has been the establishment of study groups or other R meetups to continue learning after workshops had concluded. The [Ethiopian R-ladies](https://r-ladies-addis.github.io/studyGroup/) group is an example of a meetup that came about after the first Ethiopian Data Carpentry was run in Addis Ababa in August 2017. 

If you'd like to get involved in Carpentries in Africa, please [join our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swc-za) or request a workshop by completing the [form](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/).
