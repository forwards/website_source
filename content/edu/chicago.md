### Workshop Description

Curious about package development, but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! Run by R-Ladies Chicago, the goal of this workshop is to empower you to start contributing back to the R ecosystem with package development. We'll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and Di Cook for the [Forwards teaching team](https://forwards.github.io/edu/).

By the end of this day-long workshop, you should know how to:

- make your code into an R package, 
- do collaborative coding with GitHub, 
- write a vignette or an article, 
- build a web page for your package, and
- submit a package to CRAN. 

Bring your own code that you want to make into a package, or work with our example.
