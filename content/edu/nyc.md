### Workshop Description

Have you ever wondered how data scientists formulate questions, analyze and visualize data, and draw conclusions?  In this workshop for NYC high school girls interested in STEM, coding, and data analysis, students will be introduced to coding in R through an investigation of NYC transportation data: <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data" target="_blank">Citibike</a>, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml" target="_blank">Taxi</a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf" target="_blank">Flights</a>.  Participants will receive a certificate of completion at the end of the workshop.
