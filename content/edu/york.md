Title: Forwards Package Development Workshop, York

## Package Development Workshop for women and other underrepresented groups

### Date: Tuesday, 7th January, 2020, 10:30-15:30
### Location: University of York

Forwards is the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented groups and we are offering a free workshop designed for people who use R coding and want to learn more about creating impact from their code. It will cover package contribution and development thus addressing the skills gap that exists within the R and scientific coding community. For example, an analysis of CRAN package maintainers estimated that fewer than 15% were women, and a useR! participant survey found that women were less likely than men to have experience contributing to or writing packages. Whilst these data apply to women, underrepresented groups also include, but are not limited to, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of colour.

Workshop participants will learn to make code into an R package, do collaborative coding with GitHub, write a vignette or an article, build a package web page, and submit a package to CRAN. Participants can bring their own code that they wish to develop into a package or work with a provided example.
