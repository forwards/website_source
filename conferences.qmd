Forwards works to promote diversity and inclusion at R community conferences, especially useR!, the main R conference organized by the R Foundation.

In 2016 we made a [series of recommendations](docs/recommendations_user.qmd), which have led to many improvements

 - increased representation of women in invited roles (speakers, program committee, session chairs)
 - increased representation of women in contributed program and attendees
 - newcomer-focused sessions since 2017 (excluding 2020 due switching to a virtual event)
 - diversity scholarships since 2016
 - childcare since 2017
 - code of conduct from 2016, with standard code of conduct adopted in 2020
 
More recently, we have been focusing on global representation and accessibility for people with disabilities.
